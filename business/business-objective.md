## Critical Assumptions and Constraints&#x20;

* The project's first phase will be done in a month's time or so.&#x20;
* The project's scope will not be altered in the first iteration.&#x20;

## Analysis of Options and Recommendation&#x20;

The app will be built with Kotlin and using Jetpack compose amongst other things.&#x20;

## Preliminary Project Requirements&#x20;

The app needs to showcase a proof of concept while having the right architecture.&#x20;

## Budget Estimate and Financial Analysis&#x20;

The authors are all volunteers and are doing the project for their own sake.&#x20;

## Schedule Estimate

The ideal time frame would be around the 3 weeks to a month time peroid. A rough schedule would not be bad to have in mind. This will be one sprint and simulate that.&#x20;
