# Management

Since this idea was started by Stephane Katende. The bulk of the management will be handled by him but more are welcomed to chip in. The more voices in the matter the better. As my teacher has told me Software Enginners built the house first and then get on top to see if things stay in place and act accordingly. We are doing the agile approach and almost have to plan less to achieve more but being safe is never bad. A small start in management areas is never bad and if more issues show up then more management needs to be done in that area.&#x20;

## Management Areas&#x20;

This is more than we will ever need to care about. The picture is here mostly for refrences and give a slight idea of how to attack things. A lot of things do not apply and can be ommited but in general everything worth caring for should be measured.&#x20;
