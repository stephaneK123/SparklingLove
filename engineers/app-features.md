# App Features

We started this on the [archives](google-drive-archives.md). Here will lie the general high level listing of the features the app could have. The important thing is to work on a set of features per iterations (typicallys 2 to 4 weeks long). We will follow test driven design approach and essentially have tests already made and use Github to control our work flow.&#x20;

1. flash screen&#x20;
2. notifications&#x20;
3. database&#x20;
   1. we keep track of reported user&#x20;
4. indetify a bot&#x20;
   1. the big deal, biggest piece of the app&#x20;
   2. will take a lot of work&#x20;
   3. how to recieve profile&#x20;
      1. easiest way is profile link
