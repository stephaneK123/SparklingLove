SparklingLove is an application intended to **help users on the internet trust one another**. The truth is somewhere lies an **imposter** amongst us (litersally). These imposters or bots are not real humans and can deceive business costing them **millions** of dollars and lower the **quality** of our internet experience. A simple and yet charming, sparkling, and loving idea will provide a one stop shop for proper user validation **wherever** and **whenever**. This value will be provided in a top edge well design mobile application ready at your finger tips. All you need to do is send us the profile you wish to interigate and we take care of the rest in the background. In matter of seconds we will have enough information to give an analysis of said person and provide you more information than you will know what to do with. When you want to know who's really being that account SparklingLove **will** tell you.&#x20;
