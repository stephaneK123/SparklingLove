## Scope

The first scope of the project is to just get a proof of concept going and lunched. This means an app up and running on the app store. The app has atleast one features implemented fully and set up to potentially be ready for more work as desired. The app does not need to be super complex in nature but rather just show a decent amount of effort by a group of developers. The app should be clean and be relatively stable.&#x20;
